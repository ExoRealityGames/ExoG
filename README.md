ExoG is a game engine being developed by Mia B. Regula (doing business as
ExoReality™ Games). The intention is to create a basic game engine that supports
continuous integration and delivery, both failfast and failsafe exception
handling, the ECS programming model, and a node-based programming model built on
top of the ECS model.

The core language for game creation will be C++ with support for behavioral
blueprints in the editor and scripting using a variety of languages, including
both C# and a special purpose scripting language. Blueprints are compiled as
part of the project. Scripts may be AOT compiled, JIT compiled, or interpretted,
depending on the language used, the project settings, and possibly the script's
resource settings.


## Compiling

ExoG is currently being developed as a Visual Studio 2022 solution using the
C++20 standard. This will change as the required tooling gets built.


## Current State

Just getting started.


## Roadmap

To be determined. The current goal is to create the tools that will be used to
compile, integrate and test the engine. Then work will begin on its core
features.
